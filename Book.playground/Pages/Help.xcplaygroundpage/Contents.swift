 This playground serves as a rough playground or testing area for developers and readers of this book.
 You can copy and paste code snippets from the chapter-wise playground into this space to run and debug them. For certain snippets that use delegate-based APIs or specific classes, you may need to use your own sample app. This is because some APIs must be executed within a specific target or host application.

 Feel free to explore, tweak the code to fit your understanding, and most importantly—have fun.

 Happy coding! 🙌🏻
