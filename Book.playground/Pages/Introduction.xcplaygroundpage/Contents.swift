 Welcome! This Swift Playground contains code snippets designed to help you understand key concepts in Swift programming. Some of the snippets are intentionally not fully completed — they are meant to provide a conceptual overview or highlight a specific idea, syntax, or logic structure.

 You may come across code that:

 Is partially written to focus on a particular part of a solution.

 May not compile as-is, but is still useful for learning.

 Is presented without full context to keep things simple and focused.

 Feel free to experiment, complete the missing parts, and explore how the code behaves!
